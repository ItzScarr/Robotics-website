                  This website will go through the steps of how the artefact of the Robotic Hand was built, and the processes and experiences I went through while trying to find the best way to create it. I will be displaying 3D models and 2D of the artefact to demonstrate the processes of how it went from basic scan to full out artefact. The website will also be going through why and how each workshop was or was not used for the creation of the artefact with details of production phases and in depth reasons as to why certain materials was used.

                  This section will detail the production phase of the robotic hand, including materials used, tools accessed, challenges encountered, and how the build process was approached from initial assembly through to testing and final adjustments. To start off with the materials was an important part to making the artefact, to decide what to include in the artefact we did some research inside the. PLA is a polyactic acid and the best for printing this artefact because it is a easy to print material with a low cooling temperature and compared to other materials like nylon or polycarbonate it is cheaper. In conclusion the best material for this artefact was PLA this is because it is better for printing the artefact, and better for the overall goal of this artefacct which is to create a hinge for the finger tip and thumb to hold objects.

                <p style="margin: 0;">
                  This section will explain how the workshop for 3D scanning worked and what was used to create a hand scan of a hand to create a prototype. 3D scanning is a process where an item is scanned through a scanner where it takes all the edges and details of the item and import it onto a software where the item can be edited and changed and put together to create a realistic model of the item. The reason we decided to use 3D scanning is because the artefact needed a model to be scanned off and to create the hand model as accurately as possible, so a 3D scan of a hand was necessary to be able to build the model later using blender to be able to 3D print. To start off with a hand was chosen to scan preferably the smallest hand out of the group and the hand was laid on top of a white table with a grid taped on it. Then using a scanner both sides off the hand was scanned and important into a software where both sides were put together to create the hand model.

                <p style="margin: 0;">
                  This section will go into the Motion capture workshop. Motion capture is a process where a person would where a suit with pointers on it and multiple sensors around an area usually referred to as a stage. The sensors pick up the pointers from a 360 degree angle and the pointers will be placed at the around all of the limbs so that when the person moves the sensor will pick up the movement of the pointers. This will be recorded and exported to a software where the user can edit the parts of the frames to make sure all the pointers works and to chose what parts of the recording the user wants. The use cases for this would be if you would need the model of the movement for an animation of a video game character or a movie that uses CGI. The reason the artefact did not need this was because it is a simple hand that only had two joints therefore the animation for the movement was not necessary since it can only move two different directions up or down.

                <p style="margin: 0;">
                  This section will go into how CAD works and what applications it has for the artefact. CAD is short for Computer Aided Design, what this does is allow the user to create precise drawings and models of 2D and 3D artefacts. Some of the common uses for CAD is architecture for buildings and floor plans, mechanical Engineering for designing parts or machines, product design for prototyping and modelling customer products, and Electrical engineering for designing a circuit and control systems. There are types of CAD software such as 2D software such as AutoCAD LT. For 3D modelling Fusion 360 or Autodesk inventor. Parametric CAD for designs that change based on the parameters which is used for engineering. And freeform CAD which is sued for more artistic or conceptual designs this would be software like Blender. To create a model to 3D print for the artefact we decided that Blender was the best outlet for creating a 3D model for the hand with the addition of creating the hinge for the finger and thumb. The reason Blender was used is because it was the most familiar software to use which is important because without the use of blenders easy to use UI it would be very difficult to create the hinge and for the thumb and finger.

                <p style="margin: 0;">
                  This section covers the 3D modelling applications used to shape and refine the robotic hand's form. It includes discussion of tools for sculpting, rendering, and preparing models for production. This goes into a lot from the previous section since this is going into 3D modelling as a whole instead of, specifically CAD. 3D modelling is the process of creating a 3D model for any object or surface allowing the object to be displayed in a volumetric way. A 3D model is made up of three parts Vertices which are points of the object, edges which connect the vertices, faces which are the surfaces that are made from the edges. All of this combined to create a 3D model. There are a number of 3D modelling techniques such as polygonal modelling which is using polygons to build complex surfaces typically used for video games and film characters. NURBS modelling which uses curves instead of polygons for smooth accurate surfaces which is typically used for automotive and industrial design. sculpting which uses digital clay modelling with brushes, this is for character creation for films and video games. Parametric modelling which uses models that are controlled by parameters and constraints this is for engineering and CAD software’s. Some of the best software’s for 3D modelling is Blender, Autodesk software’s, 3DS Max, SolidWorks and fusion 360, Rhino, and ZBrush. The way the artefact required 3D modelling is because it is needed to create a digital representation of the artefact that can be exported and used for 3D printing purposes. The software used for the 3D modelling was Blender since it was the most familiar software to use that can also be used to export to .STL for 3D printing applications. The software was used to design the hinge for the hand and finger hinges.                </p>
